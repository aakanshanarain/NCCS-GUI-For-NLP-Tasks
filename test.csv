   (B)  ""Left breast wide excision"":
   Sections of the breast show an invasive carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular
   features. The ductal component comprises cells with moderate-to-marked nuclear
   pleomorphism forming cohesive nests and infiltrative trabeculae. Focally, a
   morphologically distinct lobular component is seen, exhibiting relatively
   rounded cell contours and occasional intracytoplasmic lumina, arranged in linear
   files and vague targetoid configurations. E-cadherin immunohistochemical
   staining reveals strong membranous positivity within the ductal component, while
   the lobular component discloses diminished, incomplete, granular and punctate
  staining, corroborating the morphological impression. Minimal high-grade ductal
   carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) is present. An isolated lobule suspicious for lobular
   carcinoma-in-situ (LCIS) is seen (B9); however, the lesional area is no longer
 present on a subsequent section obtained for E-cadherin immunohistochemical
   studies. Approximately 60% of the tumour bed is occupied by viable tumour, with
   the remaining area constituted by relatively hypocellular fibrocollagenous
   tissuecontaining a sparse infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells.

   The specimen was fixed in formalin for 6-48 hours. A negative result for
   c-erb-B2 by immunohistochemical methods may not be valid if the specimen has
   been fixed for <6 hours or >48 hours. For ER and PR, negative results may not be
   valid if specimen fixation is <6 hours or >72 hours.
   Note : Paraffin sections of the formalin fixed tissue are stained for estrogen
   receptor using Neomarker RM9101-S, progesterone receptorusing Neomarker
   RM9102-S and c-erb-B2 using Neomarker RM9103-S. The detection system used is the
   Ventana multimer detection kit. For estrogen and progesterone receptor study, a
   result is considered positive if at least 1% of the lesional cells display any
   intensity of unequivocal nuclear staining. For c-erb-B2, a test is considered
   positive if at least 30% of the lesional cells exhibit 3+ cell membrane staining
   and a borderline/equivocal result is given when at least 10% of the lesional
   cells show 2+ cytoplasmic membrane staining.  Results which fail to fulfil the
   above criteria are considered negative.
   ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: The background breast parenchyma shows areas of adenosis,
   usual ductal hyperplasia, apocrine metaplasia and columnar cell change. Numerous
   intraductal microcalcifications are noted. An irregular area of fibrosis is
   seen, associated with haemosiderin-laden macrophages and foreign body-type giant
   cells, in keeping with changes expected at a previous biopsy site.

   (1) The specimen was fixed in formalin for 6-72 hours. A negative result for ER
   and PR by immunohistochemical methods may not be valid if specimen fixation is
   <6 hours or >72 hours.
   Note: Paraffin sections of the formalin fixed tissue are stained for estrogen
   receptor using Thermoscientific Estrogen Receptor SP1 (RM9101-S) and
   progesterone receptor using Ventana Progesterone Receptor 1E2. The detection
   system used is the Ventana multimer detection kit. For estrogen and progesterone
   receptor study, a result is considered positive if at least 1% of the tumour
   cells display any intensity of unequivocal nuclear staining. Tumours with 1-10%
   of ER expression are considered ER Low Positive. There are limited data on the
   overall benefit of endocrine therapy for patients with low level (1-10%) ER
   expression but they currently suggest possible benefit, so patients are
   considered eligible for endocrine treatment. Some data suggest that these
   tumours are heterogenous in both behaviour and biology, with gene expression
   profiles often similar to ER-negative cancers. Results which fail to fulfil the
   above criteria are considered negative.
   ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
   Florid fibrocystic changes also present include sclerosing adenosis, intraduct
   papillomas, duct dilatation and cyst formation, columnar cell change, columnar
   cell hyperplasia, usual type epithelial hyperplasia, apocrine metaplasia, and
   apocrine cysts with papillary hyperplasia. Foci of atypical duct hyperplasia,
   atypical lobular hyperplasia and benign microcalcification are also seen.  An
   area of scarring represents the site of previous biopsy.

   The specimen was fixed in formalin for 6-72 hours. A negative result for
   c-erb-B2, ER and PR by immunohistochemical methods may not be valid if specimen
   fixation is <6 hours or >72 hours.
   Note: Paraffin sections of the formalin fixed tissue are stained for estrogen
   receptor using Thermoscientific Estrogen Receptor SP1 (RM9101-S), progesterone
   receptor using Ventana Progesterone Receptor 1E2 and c-erb-B2 using
   Thermoscientific c-erb-B2 SP3 (RM9103-S). The detection system used is the
   Ventana multimer detection kit. For estrogen and progesterone receptor study, a
   result is considered positive if at least 1% of the tumour cells display any
   intensity of unequivocal nuclear staining. Tumours with 1-10% of ER expression
   are considered ER Low Positive. There are limited data on the overall benefit of
   endocrine therapy for patients with low level (1-10%) ER expression but they
   currently suggest possible benefit, so patients are considered eligible for
   endocrine treatment. Some data suggestthat these tumours are heterogenous in
   both behaviour and biology, with gene expression profiles often similar to
   ER-negative cancers. For c-erb-B2, a test is considered positive if more than
   10% of the tumour cells exhibit 3+ (complete, intense) membrane staining and an
   equivocal result (synonymous with the ""borderline"" terminology present in some
   previous reports) is given when more than 10% of the tumour cells show 2+
   (complete, weak-to-moderate) membrane staining. Incomplete, faint/barely
   perceptible membrane staining regardless of the percentage of lesional cells
   involved are considered negative, along with the cases that show no staining at
   all. Unusual staining patterns that are not covered by these definitions should
   also be considered equivocal (2+) and followed by FISH testing. Results which
   fail to fulfil the above criteria are considered negative.",Biopsy,"Breast (Left), Breast (Right)",Breast (Left); Breast (Right),Yes,Ductal Carcinoma,Ductal Carcinoma,NA,3 (Left Breast); 3 (Right Breast)
